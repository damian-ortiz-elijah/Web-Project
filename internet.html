      <h2>What is the Internet and how does date travel within the Internet?</h2>
      <p>
       The Internet is a network of computers that are interconnect between each other that 
      communicate using prtotocols that are standerized between all computers data then travels through 
      physcial connections like wires fiber optics and WiFi the key concepts include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Networks:</strong> Groups of devices that are interconnected</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protocols:</strong> Rules for data communication are IP/TCP which stands for Internet Protocol
          and Transmisission Control Protocol
        </li>
        <li>Routers then help direct packets to their destination
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reliability:</strong> These protocols help ensure both data integrity and the
          delivery of data
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- part two data encoding  -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What is Encoding?</h2>
      <p>
        How I would define encoding is a process where is taking any type of infromation that deals 
        with computers and converting it from one ofrm into another usually for the purpose of either 
        storage tarnsmission or processing 
        
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Binary:</strong> Base-2 numbering system  which is your 0s and 1s.</li>
        <li><strong>Decimal:</strong> Base-10 numbering system which is 0-9.</li>
        <li><strong>ASCII:</strong> Character encoding standard for text this is the encoding format used on your keyboard.</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Visual example of encoding -->

    <!-- part 3 what is encryption -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>What is Encryption?</h2>
      <p>
        Encryption is the process of converting data into a secure format to
        protect it from unauthorized access. It ensures confidentiality,
        integrity, and authenticity of data.
      </p>
      <h3>Symmetric Encryption</h3>
      <p>
        Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. Common use cases
        include file encryption and secure communication.
      </p>
      <h3>Asymmetric/Symmetric Encryption</h3>
      <p>
        The difference from symmetric and asymmetric encryption is symmetric encryption uses the exact 
        same key to decrypt and encrypt symmetric is usually faster but less secure asymmetric decryption 
        and encryption uses a public key that will encrypt and decrypt well on the other end you have a private 
        key that could only be used by one device that allows you to decrypt and encrypt this way sometimes takes 
        a a lil longer built also provides more protection
      </p>

      <!-- External link to an encryption tool -->

        Try an online encryption tool:

    <!-- Section 4: Secure Communication Practices -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Secure Communication Practices</h2>
      <h3>HTTPS and Security</h3>
      <p>
        HTTPS secures data that is transmitted by using SSL/TLS encryption which basically begins with a handshake 
        between what we call the browser and the server to then establish a secure connection between the two  During this handshake 
        the server provides a digital key to then prove its identity which then causes both sides to agree on a 
        shared session key by using  what id described earlier which is asymmetric encryption once the session key is all set all the data is then encrypted 
        using symmetric encryption which ensures that the information will remain private and cannot be tampered with 
        and will only accessible by the intended users 
     
      </p>
      <!-- Icon representing a secure connection -->
      <img src="..." alt="HTTPS secure connection icon" class="diagram-img" />
      <h3>Best Practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use strong and unique passwords that are hard to guess</li>
        <li>Keep software and systems up to date if they arent its easier to bypass</li>
        <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)</li>
        <li>Avoid using public WiFi for sensitive transactions becuase on some public WiFi its easy to acces sensitive info</li>
      </ul>
